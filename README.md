# Ground-State-of-H3-Using-VQE
**“Why is there no cure yet?”** is a question I frequently ask myself when I come across a heart-wrenching story of someone facing cancer, dementia, or any other debilitating illness without a cure.

When I tried to find an answer for my question, I came across an alarming result; **it takes a minimum of 10 years and ~2.6 billion dollars to research and develop a successful drug.** That's a huge amount of time and money.

Developing drugs is all about small molecules and macromolecules and the result of the interactions between them so molecular simulations play a huge role in the drug development process. Simulating a system, however, poses a challenge for conventional computers because of the overwhelming amount of data to analyze.

**Variational Quantum Eigensolvers** allow for a faster way of simulating molecular interactions, which leads to a more efficient analysis of drug candidates for researchers. This can minimize the time and resources dedicated towards developing a drug.

I implemented a VQE algorithm to find the ground state of a Triatomic Hydrogen Ion in an exponentially faster manner than classical computers. I also wrote a [Medium article](https://priyaltaneja.medium.com/entering-the-next-era-of-drug-discovery-thanks-to-vqes-7180bfa0e9a3) with a walkthrough on VQEs, their impact and an annotated copy of my code.
